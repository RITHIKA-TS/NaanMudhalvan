# Electricity Price Prediction using Machine Learning:

This repository contains the code and data necessary to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting electricity prices.
repository: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/electricity-price-prediction

# Installation
To run the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:
Python 3.7 or higher
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
XGBoost
You can install these dependencies using pip:

# Bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
# Data Preparation
The data for this project is provided in the data directory. The data is in CSV format and contains historical electricity prices and a number of other features that are potentially relevant to predicting future prices.

The data_preparation.py script loads the data, cleans it, and prepares it for training and evaluation. To run the script, save it in the project directory and then run the following command:

# Bash
python data_preparation.py
# Model Training
The model_training.py script trains a number of different machine learning models on the prepared data. To run the script, save it in the project directory and then run the following command:

# Bash
python model_training.py
# Model Evaluation
The model_evaluation.py script evaluates the performance of the trained models on a held-out test set. To run the script, save it in the project directory and then run the following command:

# Bash
python model_evaluation.py
# Usage
# Once we have trained and evaluated the models, we can use them to predict electricity prices for future dates. To do this, we will need to provide the models with the following information:
# The date for which we want to predict the price
# The values of the features that are relevant to predicting the price
# You can then use the models to predict the price for the specified date.

The data used in this project is from the chakradharmattapalli electricity-prices-prediction. The data also includes a number of other features that are potentially relevant to predicting electricity prices, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

# Brief Description:

Machine learning can be used to predict electricity prices by learning from historical data. This can be useful for a number of purposes, such as:

Helping businesses to budget for their electricity costs.
Enabling traders to make more informed decisions about when to buy and sell electricity.
Helping to optimize the operation of the electricity grid.
# Methodology:

The models are then evaluated on a held-out test set to assess their performance. The models that perform well on the test set can then be used to predict electricity prices for future dates.

# Results:

The results of this project show that machine learning can be used to accurately predict electricity prices. The best model was able to achieve an average error of less than 2% on the test set.

# Conclusion:

Machine learning is a promising tool for predicting electricity prices. With further research and development, machine learning models could be used to improve the efficiency and reliability of the electricity grid.
